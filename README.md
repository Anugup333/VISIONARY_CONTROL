Visionary Control is a smart, gesture-based control system that enables users to interact with digital media and presentation 
tools using intuitive hand gestures. It is a unified platform that improves human-computer interaction by providing touchless 
control through real-time gesture recognition. The system utilizes computer vision and hand tracking technologies to allow 
seamless operation of presentations and media players without physical contact, making it especially suited for classrooms, 
seminars, and professional environments.

It comprises two core modules: 

1.	Presentation Control using hand gesture and integrate with Face-Based Login for authentication
2.	Media Player Control using Hand gesture


The Presentation Control Module enables users to control slides, navigate content, and even draw on the screen using predefined hand gestures. This module is uniquely integrated with a Face-Based Login and Registration System, which ensures that only authenticated users can access the presentation control features. Users must register their face once, after which their identity is verified before they are granted accessâ€”providing a secure and personalized experience.


The second component, the Media Control Module, allows users to manage video or audio playback through simple hand gestures. By detecting the number of fingers shown to the camera, users can perform functions like play, pause, forward, and rewind without touching any physical controls. This module operates independently and does not require face authentication.
