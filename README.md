Visionary Control is a smart, gesture-based control system that enables users to interact with digital media and presentation 
tools using intuitive hand gestures. It is a unified platform that improves human-computer interaction by providing touchless 
control through real-time gesture recognition. The system utilizes computer vision and hand tracking technologies to allow 
seamless operation of presentations and media players without physical contact, making it especially suited for classrooms, 
seminars, and professional environments.
